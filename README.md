## Directory organization:
**File:** ItoEtAl2017_Simulations.zip
* A zip file containing simulated data generated from computational model
* Unzip prior to running ItoEtAl2017_ComputationalModelGroupAnalysis.ipynb

**File:** ItoEtAl2017_ComputationalModelTutorial.ipynb
* Contains a introductory tutorial to the formulation of the computational model used in the study
* Generates simple and illustrative figure of the simulation data

**File:** ItoEtAl2017_ComputationalModelGroupAnalysis.ipynb
* Contains code that performs group analysis on provided data (or self-generated data)
* Performs the predicted-to-actual similarity analysis steps in the information transfer mapping procedure
* Replicates several main figures in the manuscript
  * Fig. 4A, 4B, 4D.
  * All panels in Supplementary Fig. 3
* N.B. Running entire script with 10 parallel processes (on a large server) takes about 1-2 minutes. 
 
**Directory:** utils/
* **File: model.py** Contains primary functions for actually running the computational model (simulations)
  * Main method: model.subjectSimulationAndSaveToFile()
  * N.B. Running model.subjectSimulationAndSaveToFile() takes roughly 10-12 minutes per subject on a large server.
* **File: analysis.py** Contains primary functions for actually performing group analyses of simulation data.

**Directory:** figures/
* Contains figures for Supplementary Fig. 3. Figures are generated by running ItoEtAl2017_ComputationalModelGroupAnalysis.ipynb

**Directory:** htmls/
* Contains html files for each of the jupyter notebook files
